# TCG - Troll Card Game

## What's this project?

In early 2018 a group of friends decided to begin the creation of an online card game.

Every design aspect of the game is discussed and decided along the way. 
Most discussion of the game design is done through the Discord channel and conclusions are registered on the Wiki.

## Project organization

This project is divided in subprojects: The backend and one for each usable frontend.

- [**Backend**](https://github.com/doner-kebard/card-game-backend) 
- **Frontend** *(Pending)*

## Contributing

There are two main ways to contribute to this project.
- **Programming**: Everything needed to contribute by programming is explained on the appropiate subproject.
- **Designing**: All design discussion is done through the Discord channel in catalan (though we might change to spanish). To have access to the Discord channel, send a message to Masclins#8514.

In a near future, there will be a third way:
- **Testing**: When the game is in a state that allows testing, anybody willing to play it will be really helpful. We'll give guidelines on how to do so.

## Usage

This is (or will be) an online game run on a server and played through browser (at least at the beginning). That means that you'll need nothing other than a browser for playing it.
The website for playing the game will be given as soon as we have a version worth playing.

For developers, instructions on how to install and run the game are given on the appropiate subprojects.
